    <p>With experience developing for various platforms including, web, mobile and desktop, I have learnt the joys and struggles of
      trying out all kinds of technologies to see how the ecosystem works together. Connect this to that, see how it behaves,
      making sure it works as efficiently and effectively as possible not only to meet the requirements but smoothly for the actors involved.</p>
